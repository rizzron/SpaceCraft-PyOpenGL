You can move the spacecraft using the W, A, S and D keys on the keyboard. <br>
The movement of the spacecraft using the keys are achieved by translating each of the coordinates(v1,v3) of the different components of the spacecraft.<br><br> 
As soon as the animation begins, there are three larger stars (red, yellow ,blue) that you are heading towards. This illusion is achieved by scaling up those three stars at different sizes as the animation progresses.<br> <br> 
The background is a loop of randomly generated white and yellow pixels to give the illusion of stars. Furthermore, the background consists of brown circles to illustrate asteroids. <br> <br> 
Note: Every shape in this OpenGL animation is achieved by using the Midpoint Line Algorithm and Midpoint Circle Algorithm which are created separately. The image below is the output after a few minutes of it running.<br><br>
